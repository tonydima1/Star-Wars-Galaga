# Star-Wars-Galaga
Galaga like game with Star Wars theme.

Unfortunaly to have sounds and sprites it would be needed to download the sprites/sounds (png/wav files). Find their directory and place them as I have instructed in the programs.

Special Features of Game Include:

-Start Screen.
-2 Waves of enemies.
-3 types of enemies.
-Random enemy attack patterns and timings.
-Menu/Game over screens.
-Custom Star Wars sprites.
-Music.
-Sounds.

I am going to add more in the future.

Special Features of code:

-Easily add more waves.
-Easily add different combinations of enemy types.
-Easily add more enemy attack movements.

I am looking to add a 4th enemy similar to the Boss enemy from galaga. Unfortunately I have to manually create each step of the tracktor beam.
As well as figure out how to have the ship get stuck in it.

Can add additional lives with a int that counts down every time you get hit. Just need to add explosion animation which is why addition lives are not added.
